 Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are 
numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of 
keys. The function should just print the keys only.

def printDict():
	d=dict()
	for i in range(1,21):
		d[i]=i**2
	for k in d.keys():
		print k
printDict()
output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
