Write a program which can filter() to make a list whose elements are even 
number between 1 and 20 (both included).

def even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0
 
a = [2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16]
 
result = filter(even, a)
print('Original List :', a)
print('Filtered List :', list(result))
output:
Original List : [2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16]
Filtered List : [2, 8, 10, 16]
