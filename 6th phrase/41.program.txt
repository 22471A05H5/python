Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even 
numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).

evTuple = (3, 78, 67, 34, 88, 11, 23, 19)
print("Tuple Items = ", evTuple)

print("\nThe Even Numbers in this evTuple Tuple are:")
for i in range(len(evTuple)):
    if(evTuple[i] % 2 == 0):
        print(evTuple[i], end = "  ")
output:
Tuple Items =  (3, 78, 67, 34, 88, 11, 23, 19)

The Even Numbers in this evTuple Tuple are:
78  34  88
