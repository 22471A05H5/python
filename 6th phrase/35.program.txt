Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of 
numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to 
print the first 5 elements in the list.

def printValues():
	l = list()
	for i in range(1,21):
		l.append(i**2)
	print(l[0:5])
		
printValues()

output:
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
