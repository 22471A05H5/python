Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. 
The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or
Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

freq = {}   # frequency of words in text
line = raw_input("Enter Text:")
for word in line.split():
    freq[word] = freq.get(word,0)+1
 
words = freq.keys()
words.sort()
 
print "Frequency chart"
for w in words:
    print "%s:%d" % (w,freq[w])

output:
Enter Text:Hey There! Hello and hello and welcome to GlobalSQA Welcome
Frequency chart
GlobalSQA:1
Hello:1
Hey:1
There!:1
Welcome:1
and:2
hello:1
to:1
welcome:1
