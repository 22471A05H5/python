4. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers 
from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every 
number.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

l=list(map(int,input().split(','))
print(l)
s=tuple(l)
print(s)
output:
l=[1,2,3,4,5]
s=(1,2,3,4,5)
