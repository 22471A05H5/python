2.Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.The 
results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single 
line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the 
output should be:40320

fact = 1
if n < 0:
    print("Factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif n == 0:
    print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
  while(n > 0):
        fact = fact * n
        n = n - 1
  print("The factorial is",fact)
Output:
n=5
The factorial is 120
