8. Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input 
and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them 
alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

s=input("Input words:")
s_list=s.split(",")
s_list.sort()
print(', ').join(s_list))
output:
Input words:order, hello ,would ,test
